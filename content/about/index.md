I'm Sebastiano Barrera, ~~and that's why I drink~~. I'm a software engineer currently based in Turin, Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹.

For better or worse, I love computers and software in particular. I'm interested in all of it: [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) [programming](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [web](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) [programming](https://htmx.org/), [distributed programming](https://www.erlang.org/), [graphics](https://www.raylib.com/) [programming](https://www.egui.rs/), [programming programming](https://racket-lang.org/).

This blog is for notes and other musings. There isn't much right now, but it's coming!

If anything on this blog catches your attention, I'd love to know.  Feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/seb_barrera).
